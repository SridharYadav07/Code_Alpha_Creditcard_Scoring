# Code_Alpha_Creditcard_Scoring
This project performs a complete end-to-end machine learning process on the "UCI Credit Card" dataset to predict the likelihood of a person defaulting on their credit card payment in the next month. It uses the Random Forest Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm, for prediction and evaluates its performance using various metrics.
